'((python . "Use python 3.13 features, do not import Optional or List from typing, use ~None | int~ or ~list[int]~ instead. Prefer match case when possible. Always write typehints for the arguments and return types. Use double quotes. Do not arrange functions in a C language style, so all used functions in the main one should be below it. Create custom exceptions inherited from the ~Exception~ class. User dry-python.returns.result for @safe decorator and Success/Failure. If ~try..except~ is required, write as less as possible lines inside of it and use the required exception class instead of the base one (or write in a comment, that you don't know the valid one). Do not add doc strings or helper commentaries to the code. DO NOT FORMAT CODE AS org or markdown code blocks")
